  \frametitle{no referential blur metric}
  
  advantage: absolute metric, no need of the original image\\
  steps:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item vertical edges (Sobel)
  \item analysing the image image by row. Everytime a pixel that is part of an edge is found, determining the local minimum and extremum on that row.
  \item local blur = distance (in pixels) between the extrema
  \item global blur = average of local blurs
  \end{itemize}
