\subsection{angle estimation with the Gabor filter}

The Gabor filter is a gaussian filter modulated by a sinusoidal wave. The function of this filter is given by:
\begin{equation}
B(x,y)=dfrac{1}{2\pi \sigma_x \sigma_y} exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x^2}{\sigma_x^2}+ \frac{y^2}{\sigma_y^2} \right) -j\omega(xcos\phi + ycos\phi)\right],
\label{filtreGabor}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ are the standard deviations in the $x$ and $y$ directions. The parameters $\phi$ and $\omega$ are the direction and the frequency of the filter respectively. Only $\phi$ will vary while the other parameters stay fixed. According to the article \cite{dash2014motion}, experimentation has shown that good values for $\sigma$ and $\omega$ are $3$ and $1.75$ respectively. The method consists in applying the Gabor filter to the power spectrum of the blurred image and then detecting the blur angle $\alpha_{blur}$ by searching for the $\phi$ that gives the highest response value. This value can be calculated using $L_2$ norm. The $\phi$ obtained by this method is the blur angle. Here are the steps of the algorithm:

1. computation of the spectrum of the blurred image by a two dimensional Fourier transform\\
2. taking the logarithm of it\\
3. convolving this with the Gabor function given by equation $(\ref{filtreGabor})$ for different $\phi$, the result is $R(\phi)$\\
4. for every $\phi$, taking the $L_2$ norm: $||R(\phi)||_2$
5. the blur angle is the parameter $phi$ that gives the biggest norm:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{blur} = arg \left\lbrace max_{\phi}R(\phi)\right\rbrace.
\end{equation}

This algorithm is implemented by our matlab function $angle_estimator_Gabor(f,thetamin, thetamax)$, where the input $f$ is the blurred image. The parameter $\phi$ will vary from $thetamin$ to $thetamax$. If those inputs are not specified, we set them to $0$ for $thetamin$ and $180$ for $thetamax$.

All the tests we have done with this method didn't give satisfactory results. We implemented the method exactly as we just described but we couldn't find any error that leads to those bad results. 

%We made some tests with the picture of the little girl on figure (??). We blurred that image everytime with 
%$meth=2$ in our matlab function $blur$. The length was fixed at $20$ and the tests were made for different angles. The results are given in figure
