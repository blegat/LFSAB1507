\section{Camera}
On the camera case, we have a serie of images.
The images are obtained from a fixed camera capturing a fixed
background with some objects appearing in some images.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For the first images, we only estimate the background.
    The background is obtained as the mean of the pixels,
    we also calculate the variance.
  \item For each following images, we use the background and the variance
    to detect the foreground.
    We take the ``biggest'' connected shape and then deblur it.
    Once it is deblurred, we put it back on the background.
  \item We can then update the background.
    Indeed, if for example, a chair is added to the background
    or the light is changing, we need the background to be updated.
    The mean is then not exactly the mean nor the variance
    since we wand new images to have more importance than previous
    images.
\end{enumerate}
