\section{Train}
Let's summarize the model.
We know $g(x,y)$ and we know that there is a $h(x,y)$ such that
\[ g(x,y) = h(x,y) * f(x,y) + e(x,y). \]
We would like to find $f(x,y)$.
To obtain it, we need to deconvolve $g(x,y)$ with a method
robust to the noise $e(x,y)$.

However, we don't know $h(x,y)$ so we first need to estimate it
in a way that is also robust to the noise.
It is easier to estimate $h(x,y)$ if we make some assumptions.
For our problem, we have a motion blur which means that
$h(x,y)$ only depends on an angle and a length which are
respectively the angle at which the blur is and the number of
pixel on which each pixel depends.

Once we have an estimate of $h(x,y)$, we then deconvolve
$g(x,y)$ to get an estimate $\hat{f}(x,y)$.
For some deconvolution method, we need an estimate of
some properties of the noise which is done only using $g(x,y)$.
