\section{Deconvolution}
We could adapt our methods on the train differently to the camera.
We can first just use the methods on the subimage
talked about in the section~\ref{sec:fg}.

We could also only change pixels that are part of the solid
shape filled by the flood-fill.
That is how we have modified Wiener.

\subsection{Lucy-Richardson}
For Lucy-Richarson, we can do it at each iteration.
Which means that we only update pixels that are part of our
rough estimate of the background at each iteration.

A much finer solution would be to estimate the foreground
before it has been blurred more closely.
We would then be able to estimate the ratio of background
and foreground for each pixel.
Then we can remove the part of background to the pixels
which are not entirely foreground.
We will then have all the information to do an ``exact''
resolution.
